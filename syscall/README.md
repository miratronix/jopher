# syscall

A simple NPM wrapper for the GopherJS [node-syscall module](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs/blob/master/doc/syscalls.md).

## Installation
Instead of following the instructions mentioned above, you can simply:
```bash
npm install syscall
```

__NOTE__: This module has some limitations:
* It only works in OSX and Linux. 
* A C++ compiler must be present to install it.
* Node 10.0.0 or newer is required.

## Usage
Nothing special is required to use this module. If it's installed, GopherJS will pick it up.
